# Event processing with Kafka for the Pythonista

IndyPy Monthly meetup - October 11, 2016.

Data arrives at you in different forms, at varying rates from disparate sources
and is consumed by a variety of applications in some ways that even you don't
know right now.

How do you deal with this ever expanding (should we say exploding) combination?

Event processing is an umbrella word to describe the set of approaches and
technologies that deal with this kind of problem. Kafka is a well known and
popular technology stack for event processing.

In this talk, I plan to detail the event processing problem, understand the core
concepts behind Kafka, show off the primary tools associated with Kafka and
given code examples in Python to push and consume data from Kafka.
