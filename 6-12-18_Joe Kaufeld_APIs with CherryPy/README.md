# APIs with CherryPy

Welcome to my slides for the APIs with CherryPy talk! The slides that I used in the talk are above, and the two code examples that I used are below. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions / thoughts about the talk (you can find me on twitter at @joekaufeld -- that's probably easiest).

Example one: https://github.com/GrafeasGroup/tor_core/blob/master/tor_core/heartbeat.py

Example two: (still currently in alpha as I write this) https://github.com/GrafeasGroup/tor_api/blob/master/tor_api/main.py
